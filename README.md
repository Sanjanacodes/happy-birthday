This is a React-based website created with Vite to celebrate a special birthday. It features a modern, beautiful design and can be customized with personal messages, images, and interactive elements.

## Getting Started

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to the local address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Customization
